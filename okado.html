      <p>I co-authored a published poster presentation on short digital stress-reduction interventions for college students.
      </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> A significant portion of college students face high levels of stress. In this study, 
        we tested two types of brief, online mental health interventions along with a control intervention 
        to see if they could reduce self-rated scores about stress-inducing negative thoughts. How did this work? </p>

        <p>Well, let’s pretend that you’re a college student studying for a test, 
          and suddenly an automatic negative thought pops in your head. 
          The thought is: “If I fail this test, my future is ruined.” 
          Let’s see how each of the interventions in the study would teach you to handle this thought.
        </p>

          <div class="container1">
          <img class="cogModel" src="assets/images/ptsd-poster/cog-model-ptsd.jpg" 
          alt="drawing of sad person having irrational thoughts">
          </div>
          <p>In the Defusion intervention, you would learn from a short video to let the thought simply pass through 
            your mind without assigning any importance or acting on it. This is kind of like a Buddhist monk way of handling things. 
          </p>

          <div class="container1">
            <img class="cogModel" src="assets/images/ptsd-poster/cog-model-ptsd.jpg" 
            alt="drawing of sad person having irrational thoughts">
            </div>
          <p>In the Restructuring intervention, you would learn from a short video to challenge the thought with counter-arguments 
            and weigh evidence for the thought accordingly. This is kind of like a lawyer way of handling things.
          </p>

          <div class="container1">
            <img class="cogModel" src="assets/images/ptsd-poster/cog-model-ptsd.jpg" 
            alt="drawing of sad person having irrational thoughts">
            </div>
          <p>In the control intervention, you would simply freely write about your thought. This is kind of like a teenager way 
            of handling things.
          </p>
          
      <p class="hypothesis">So which intervention works the best for reducing stress?</p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>We had three separate groups of students for each type of intervention. After they all watched a brief video tutorial on 
        stress or their intervention, once a day they were asked to apply the intervention on a negative thought about the most 
        stressful event they had that day. They then rated the negative thought on several axes which we won’t get into here. </p>

      <p>Long story short, the Restructuring (lawyer) intervention showed no significant reduction in their ratings of 
        stressful negative thoughts, while the Defusion (Monk) and the control (teenager) interventions were successful in 
        reducing ratings of stressful negative thoughts. How interesting!</p>

      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>This poster is less decipherable than the PTSD one. My collaborator and I were required to fit a lot of information into the poster, and 
        as a result I found we found it difficult to make it readable. I hope that an HCI degree can teach me how to visually convey dense 
        information more effectively. </p>
