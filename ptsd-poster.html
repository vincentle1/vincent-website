      <p>I created a published poster presentation exploring potential predictors of PTSD
        symptom severity.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> There are various psychological theories that attempt to explain the severity of symptoms in 
        those afflicted by Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>A. The Cognitive Model</h3>
          <div class="container1">
          <img class="cogPic" src="assets/images/ptsd-poster/cog-model-ptsd.jpg" 
          alt="drawing of sad person having irrational thoughts">
          </div>
          <p>One such theory is the cognitive model, which argues that following a traumatic 
            event, PTSD sufferers gain irrational beliefs about the world. 
            Individuals with PTSD might see the world as an impossibly dangerous 
            place, and they might conclude that they are incapable of facing it. 
            These beliefs perpetuate their symptoms.</p>
          </li>
        <li>
          <h3>B. The ACT Model</h3>
          <div class="container2">
            <img class="actPic" src="assets/images/ptsd-poster/act-model-picture.jpg" 
            alt="drawing of sad person moving away from aversive situations">
            </div>
          <p>A competing theory is the ACT model, which claims that experiential avoidance is 
            the primary cause of psychological distress in PTSD sufferers. 
            Experiential avoidance is defined as “the attempt to alter the form, frequency, or 
            situational sensitivity of difficult private events, even when doing so leads to 
            actions that are inconsistent with one’s values and goals.” In other words, the 
            ACT model says that because PTSD sufferers avoid triggers of the trauma, this 
            actually increases the severity of their symptoms.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p class="hypothesis">The question is, does experiential avoidance from the ACT model play any role in 
        predicting PTSD symptom severity once you’ve already controlled for irrational beliefs? 
        This is the question I set out to answer.</p>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>I used an existing dataset from professor Christine D. Scher at California State University, Fullerton. 
        Previously, she had surveyed students at Cal State Fullerton who all met criteria for experiencing a 
        traumatic event. She had them complete self-report measures of experiential avoidance (ACT Model) and 
        maladaptive beliefs (Cognitive Model). I took the data, and cleaned it in R 
        (I actually learned how to program with R for this project). You can see all of the code 
        on the GitHub link at the top of the page. I then ran statistical analyses. You can find 
        my results in the poster and linked abstract!</p>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>I focused on making the research poster as clear and readable as possible. Here are the two guidelines 
        I kept in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Get to the point immediately</h3>
          <p> Borrowing the idea from <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/24/theres-movement-
            better-scientific-posters-are-they-really-better">Ph.D. candidate Mike Morrison</a>, 
            I made the hypothesis of the poster vivid and eye-catching in the “Primary Finding” section. 
            In an academic conference, most people just quickly scan posters as they walk by. 
            By getting to the point immediately, I might sufficiently intrigue them 
            to stop and get more details.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Make the poster easy to read</h3>
          <p>To do this, I used the least amount of text possible to convey my ideas. I also chose a 
            simple, eye-catching color scheme with plenty of white space for enhanced readability. 
            Finally, I kept columns spaced far apart so that the reader’s eyes would naturally flow 
            down a column without being attracted to lateral text from other columns.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>That’s it! Hope you enjoy looking through my research!</p>
