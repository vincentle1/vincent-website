      <p>I co-wrote an original research paper on multilingualism and emotional expression.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> To understand the paper, you’ll need to follow two chains of reasoning.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>1. Multilingual Cognition</h3>
          <p>Here’s the first chain of reasoning. Experimental evidence demonstrates that multilingual 
              individuals are better than monolingual individuals at complex rule-based decision making. 
              Why? Well, quoting directly from the paper, “...multilinguals have had to learn the 
              rules of multiple languages as well as learn to combine rules between and within them 
              to avoid social missteps.”</p>
          </li>
        <li>
          <h3>2. Self-Construals</h3>
          <p>Here’s the second chain of reasoning. A self-construal is how a person views themselves 
              and understands their relationship to the outside world. 
              In Western culture, people frequently have what is called an 
              independent self-construal. This means that they prize 
              emotional expression as a way of asserting their distinctive 
              personalities. In contrast, Easterners frequently have an 
              interdependent self-construal. They value emotional suppression in order 
              to maintain social harmony, because they believe personality and the self only
              makes sense “in light of the broader social context.”
        </p>
          </li>
        <li>
        <h3>3. Putting it Together</h3>
        <p>If multilingual individuals are better at complex rule-based cognition in general, 
            they might be more adept at following social norms. 
            Thus, we predicted that they would be more likely to express emotions 
            “in accordance with their self-construals.” More specifically, if a multilingual 
            person has an interdependent self-construal, they are going to suppress their 
            emotions more than a monolingual interdependent person, while a multilingual person 
            with an independent self-construal is more likely to express their emotions than a 
            monolingual independent person. Let’s visualize the predictions here. The higher 
            the number, the higher the emotional expressivity of people who fall into that group.
        </p>

        </div>
        </ul>
        <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To explore our hypothesis, we surveyed 316 undergraduate students with an 
             online questionnaire. These students filled out a Self-Construal Scale, to 
             find out whether they had independent or interdependent construals, and two questionnaires 
             to measure their emotional expressivity.
            </p>
            <p>I would normally just have you read the paper to get all the details, but honestly, 
                it’s a pretty dense and technical read. So, I’ll lay out what we found here. After 
                running statistical analyses, we found the following: Interdependent multilinguals 
                suppressed their emotions more than interdependent monolinguals, but independent 
                multilinguals did NOT report more emotional expression than independent multilinguals. 
                That was probably pretty confusing to read. Once again, let’s map out our results. 
                Remember, the higher the number, the higher the emotional expressivity of that group.

            </div> 
        
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>My co-writer Hailey actually came up with the hypothesis and ran the analyses. 
          My job was to rewrite the Introduction, write the Results, and write the Discussion 
          Section. As the target audience was fellow psychology researchers, my writing was very 
          technical. Because the hypothesis was so complex, it was a challenge to keep the paper 
          as lean and clear as possible. Frankly, I don’t think I succeeded in that, but I’ve tried 
          to simplify the paper here on this page. That’s it!
